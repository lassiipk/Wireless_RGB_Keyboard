# Wireless RGB Mechanical Keyboard (96%)

## About
I am building a custom mechanical keyboard with USB-C and Bluetooth.
The goal is to learn electronics, PCB design, and firmware, while
creating a keyboard I can fully control and modify.

## Features I Plan to Build
- USB-C wired mode
- Bluetooth wireless mode
- Per-key RGB lighting
- Large battery for long usage
- Open-source firmware (ZMK)

## Why I’m Building This
I want hands-on experience with:
- Electronics & soldering
- PCB design
- Microcontrollers
- Open-source hardware

## Current Progress
- Created keyboard layout using Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE)
- Installed KiCad
- Learning how to document and plan the project

## Next Steps
- Finalize documentation
- Learn basics of PCB design
- Choose components for the keyboard

## Progress Update #1
Date: 18-Dec-2025
Time: 3:00 AM

What I did:
- Created a project log and documentation
- Designed a 96% keyboard layout using KLE
- Set up a GitHub repository for the project
- Organized files locally (notes, screenshots, layouts)

What I learned:
- How to document a hardware project
- How keyboard layouts are structured
- Why planning is important before building

Next goal:
- Learn basic keyboard electronics (rows, columns, MCU)
