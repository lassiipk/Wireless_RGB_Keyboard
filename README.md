# Wireless RGB Mechanical Keyboard (96%)

## About
I am building a custom mechanical keyboard with USB-C and Bluetooth.
The goal is to learn electronics, PCB design, and firmware, while
creating a keyboard I can fully control and modify.

## Features I Plan to Build
- USB-C wired mode
- Bluetooth wireless mode
- Per-key RGB lighting
- Large battery for long usage
- Open-source firmware (ZMK)

## Why I’m Building This
I want hands-on experience with:
- Electronics & soldering
- PCB design
- Microcontrollers
- Open-source hardware

## Current Progress
- Created keyboard layout using Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE)
- Installed KiCad
- Learning how to document and plan the project

## Next Steps
- Finalize documentation
- Learn basics of PCB design
- Choose components for the keyboard
